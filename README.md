#  Interception driver
This is an example of a simple interceptor driver for Windows XP. This driver intercepts the NtCreateFile kernel function by changing its import table, replacing the address of this function with its own address. As a result, when the system needs to call the NtCreateFile function (for example, a user opens a file with a double click), our own code is executed. In this example, when trying to open a file with an extension .txt will open a file with the same name, but with a different one .doc extension. The main part of the driver code is to find the desired function by the name (which we want to capture) in the import table. So if you need to intercept a kernel function that you need, it will be easy to do so by changing the source code.
